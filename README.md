# Black Hat Python Scripts (Python 3)

Welcome to the "Black Hat Python Scripts (Python 3)" repository. This project is a collection of Python 3 scripts based on the book Black Hat Python by Justin Seitz. The original book's code was written in Python 2, and as part of my study, I have taken on the task of rewriting these scripts in Python 3, enhancing them for modern cybersecurity practices and Python standards.

As I delve into Black Hat Python, I'm not only translating the code from Python 2 to Python 3 but also integrating my own solutions and improvements inspired by additional online resources related to the book. This repository serves as a living document of my learning journey, showcasing the practical application of Python in cybersecurity.

## Disclaimer

The scripts included in this repository are for educational purposes only. They are meant to illustrate the concepts and techniques discussed in Black Hat Python and should be used with caution. The author and contributors to this repository are not responsible for any misuse or damage resulting from the use of these scripts.
Project Status

This is an ongoing project. Scripts will be added and updated as my study progresses. Feedback, suggestions are welcome to improve the scripts and adapt them to the ever-evolving Python ecosystem.

# Getting Started

To get started with these Python 3 scripts, follow the steps below:

- **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine to get a copy of the scripts:
- **Explore the Scripts**: Navigate through the repository to find scripts of interest. Each script is a standalone example of a specific concept or technique from Black Hat Python.
- **Read the Comments**: Before running a script, open it in your preferred text editor or IDE and read the comments. Each script contains detailed comments explaining how it works and how to use it, providing valuable context and guidance.
- **Run the Scripts**
- **Have fun!**
