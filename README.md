Black Hat Python Scripts (Python 3)

This repository contains Python 3 code for the book Black Hat Python by Justin Seitz. The code in the book was originally written in Python 2, so as I study the book, I have been rewriting the code in Python 3.

Some of the code is my own, while other parts have been rewritten from online resources related to the book. Nevertheless, all of the code is commented and explained in the way that I understood it, which may be incorrect at times, so please proceed with caution.

Although this is an ongoing project, I have made it available for anyone who is interested and may find it useful.
